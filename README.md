# CS-305
Course work for the CS-305, Software Security Course.

1. Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
- Our client for these projects was Artemis Financial, a company that creates specialized financial plans for its clients. To help them achieve this goal, the clients needed the ability to securely share sensitive data and files, and to ensure they are shared and stored securely. The client wanted us to address the program's security and ensure it met modern standards and followed appropriate coding practices to protect their users.
2. What did you do well when you found your client's software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company's overall well-being?
- The area in which I excelled during this project was finding solutions to the potential vulnerabilities found within the code. While some code was initially provided for the project, my review highlighted issues, including a lack of authentication and input validation, that revealed potential vulnerabilities in the application that needed to be addressed going forward. Fixing these issues and avoiding the anti-patterns in the initial code were essential to ensuring the project remains free of potential vulnerabilities as it expands. It was essential to rework the initial code and ensure it was coded securely, since including vulnerabilities in the project could compromise user security and leave the site more vulnerable to attacks. Additionally, failing to address these issues in the initial stages of the project would result in them persisting in the final project, which could compromise the user experience and deter future users. Failing to secure software can significantly impact a company, as failing to address vulnerabilities and regularly ensure the project's security can result in user and sensitive data being compromised, or even in the project itself being compromised. Either outcome would reflect poorly on the company and potentially harm its business and profits.
3. Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
- While the dependency checker was challenging initially, it proved its usefulness, and the time spent installing, running, and deciphering its output was worthwhile. Having access to automation can reduce the time required to perform specific tasks, freeing up time to spend elsewhere. While the dependency checker had the potential to create false positives, it ultimately proved its worth by reducing the time needed to check for known issues across the project's dependencies. Being able to review the report quickly made it apparent which vulnerabilities were present in specific dependencies and how they affected the project. In terms of false positives, these were easy to fix: simply suppressing issues with no potential fixes or that were falsely reported can be done relatively quickly and solves the issue for future reports as well. In the end, while it took some time to install and run the dependency checker across the projects, the effort was worthwhile, as it allowed us to view the known vulnerabilities within the projects so we could be aware of them and find potential solutions.
4. How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
- To increase the layers of security for this project, multiple security practices were introduced across its various parts. This approach ensured that all parts of the project were secured, so even if one security measure is bypassed, others can still prevent a potential attack. For instance, requiring users to connect to the site via HTTPS helps ensure that they communicate with the site securely and that malicious individuals cannot intercept their data as it is sent to and from the site. However, even with this security improvement, users can still be vulnerable when first establishing a connection to the site, so to prevent this issue, the additional security measure of implementing a private key and using a certificate authority to validate the site's identity was added. This addition ensures that users are directed to our real site rather than a masquerading site that could compromise their safety. Thus, by adding multiple security practices that run in tandem, the user and the site itself are less likely to fall victim to potential attacks that could compromise their security. Going forward, I plan to use the Vulnerability Assessment Process Flow, as it highlights the key security areas present in nearly every project. Having a reference sheet helps ensure that all important areas are accounted for and at least considered when checking for vulnerabilities within a project. Using this sheet makes it easier to understand which mitigation techniques, such as updating dependencies, adding error handling, or encrypting data, are needed for specific security areas.
5. How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
- While fixing code issues is necessary, it is equally important to ensure that any changes introduce no additional vulnerabilities. To ensure the code was functional and secure, I ran it in the development environment, tested all added features for issues, and moved to the next feature only after confirming the first was added correctly. While manual review and testing were important, I also used the IDE's debugging features to verify that the code was functional. Even after the issue was solved, there was a potential that I introduced a new vulnerability. To ensure the added code did not introduce new vulnerabilities, I used industry-vetted secure coding practices when adding new features, as these industry-standard coding practices were already tested and confirmed to be free of potential vulnerabilities.
6. What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
- The primary tool I will reuse in the future is the Dependency Checker for every one of my projects. Automating the process of checking for vulnerabilities in dependencies, specifically those that are present, saves a lot of time and makes it easier to know which dependencies need to be updated or patched. Removing the significant time commitment required to review dependencies provides more time to work on the project. Additionally, it makes it more likely that I can stay up to date and aware of vulnerabilities as they are discovered.
7. Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
- The significant aspect of this project that stuck out for me was the implementation of the checksum generator. Not only was this a crucial feature of the project, as it improved one of the significant security areas, Input Validation, but it was my first attempt at using a hash function to generate values. Knowing that this feature is still used in the majority of projects is another significant benefit, as the knowledge I gained from implementing this hash function can be applied to my future projects. Demonstrating experience and familiarity with implementing and properly using hash functions in a project can be a significant benefit when seeking future employment in this field.
